# The Cube Suite, a nostalgic feast for the ears

Welcome to the Cube Suite!

The Cube Suite is a series of sound packs and themes for various Microsoft Windows applications, consisting of short, high quality, retro-sounding dings and musical tunes. These sounds were inspired by those of old school operating systems and programs. They are designed to take you back to a simpler time. A time when UI sounds had life, charm, style and meaning. A time when computers really had a voice of their own!

On this site, you will find links to every single sound pack housed within the Cube Suite. Previously, these packs were scattered around various places of my main website, but now, they have an official place to call home!

## Credits and thanks

*   A huuuuuuuuuge thank you to [Day Garwood](https://daylightsound.org/) for helping me out with the Cheese Cube Windows installer. Without his help, I most likely wouldn't have the motivation to keep creating these packs. He took a day out of his busy life to help me out, so he deserves the most credit, hence why he's at the top of this list!
*   Thanks to all of you who download and use one or more of these packs. It really does mean the world to me!
*   And of course, I kinda have to thank myself for creating the sounds so that these packs can be used in the first place! :)

Happy cubing!
